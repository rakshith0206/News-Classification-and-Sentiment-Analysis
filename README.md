# News Article Web Scrapping and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview: 
This project contains full code for 'How to scrap the news article from websites and their sentiment analysis'. Once scrapping is done, then we have used Lemmatization, Stemming, Vectorization techniques to analyze the sentiments and behaviors

## Usage:
For News Article scraping -
The file 'NewsPapers.json' contains news website links. This file will be used in the 'News Data Scraping .ipynb' file. Once all the articles are scrapped, data will be saved into another csv file
For sentiment analysis and Machine Learning - 
Run the file 'CSYE 7245- Big-Data Systems & Intelligence Analytics Project.ipynb'
